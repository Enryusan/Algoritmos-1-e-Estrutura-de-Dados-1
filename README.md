This repository contains the codes I developed during the Algorithms 1 and Data Structures 1 courses. It serves as a record of my learning and progress in programming and data structures.

ðŸ“š About the Repository

The codes here were created as part of practical activities and projects proposed during the courses. They range from solutions to simple problems to implementations of more advanced data structure concepts.

ðŸ—‚ Structure

The repository is organized by topics covered in the courses:

Algorithms 1

    Basic Concepts:
        Sequential programming
        Conditionals (if, else, switch)
        Loops (for, while, do-while)
        Operators (relational and logical)
    Functions:
        Creating and using functions
        Parameter passing
    Simple Data Structures:
        Arrays (one-dimensional and two-dimensional)
        Basic search and sorting algorithms

Data Structures 1

    Lists:
        Singly and doubly linked lists
    Stacks and Queues:
        Implementations and use cases
    Trees:
        Binary trees and basic operations

ðŸš€ Purpose

This repository reflects my practical learning. It can also serve as a future reference or help other students studying the same topics.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

    Languages: C and C++
    Editor/IDE: Visual Studio Code

ðŸ’¡ How to Use
